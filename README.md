# iOS App README

This iOS app is a simple SwiftUI application that primarily displays a "Hello World" text on the screen. The app is built using [Trace AI](https://trace.zip) and can be demoed at [this link](https://trace.zip/c/156857c5-328a-4c68-9d03-d4e22104ebcc).

## Building the App

To build the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Xcode project file.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.

## Code Overview

The main view of the app is defined in the `ContentView` struct, which conforms to the `View` protocol. The `body` property of the `ContentView` struct returns a `Text` view displaying "Hello World".

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Text("Hello World")
    // write your Swift UI code here
  }
}
```

The `ContentView_Previews` struct is used to provide a preview of the `ContentView` in Xcode's canvas.

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    ContentView()
  }
}
```

As you make changes to the code, the app's appearance and behavior will change accordingly.
